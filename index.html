        <p>Alan Olav Walker is a British-Norwegian DJ, YouTuber and record producer, primarily known for the critically acclaimed single "Faded", which was certified platinum in 14 countries. Other songs include "Sing Me to Sleep", "Alone", "Darkside", and "Routine", all of which attracted millions of views
           .Alan Olav Walker was born on 24 August 1997 in Northampton, England to Anglo-Scottish British Philip Alan Walker, and his Norwegian wife Hilde Omdal Walker. As a result, by his international parental inheritance, he was granted dual citizenship from both the United Kingdom and Norway. He grew up with two siblings, an elder sister named Camilla, who was also born in England; and a younger brother named Andreas, who was born in Norway.<br><br><br>
            At the age of two, along with his family, he moved to Bergen, Norway. Walker later found interest in computers, a hobby which has driven him deeper to computing graphical design, and musical programming. 
            He initially had no musical background,
            but was able to teach himself by watching YouTube tutorials based on musical production.
            At the beginning of 2017, Walker's YouTube channel became the most subscribed channel registered in Norway, after passing about 4.5 million subscribers, and had the most views among Norwegian YouTubers at around 7.7 billion views as of 25 January 2020. Between February and April, he toured around America including attending the Euphoria Festival in Texas.
             In 2019, Alan's music video ''Diamond Heart'' received a nomination for Best Cinematography at the Berlin Music Video Awards. His music video for ''Heading Home'' featuring Ruben appears on the festival's 2021 Silver Screenings selection list..
